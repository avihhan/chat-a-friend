# chat-a-friend
A chat app made using Socket.io

This app allows you to create multiple chatrooms and connect users to a chatroom securely. It uses Socket.io, so unlike regular HTTP requests, the application sends sockets which are tiny packets of information back and forth at various steps of code which makes the back-end and the client almost interwinded for smoother and faster communication.
